# 11 &mdash; Postgres 9.6 container with volume mapping
> a Postgres 9.6 server container in which the data directories are mapped to host directories

## Description
This file contains technical details describing how the container image was built and some info about the decisions taken.

For details about how to build the container image and run it, please refer to the container's [README.md](./postgres96-container/README.md).

The container specification found in [./postgres96-container](./postgres56-container/) is a simple Postgres 9.6 server Docker container specification in which the data files are mapped to a volume outside of the container.

To achieve the statelessness of the container, the directory `pgdata` is mapped to `/var/lib/postgresql/data` inside the container. Thus, all the stateful data generated by the container will be available in the host file system, and can be reused with different containers.
